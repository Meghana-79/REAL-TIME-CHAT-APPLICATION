TASK-2

To build a real-time chat application, we will use WebSockets for live message exchange and a front-end framework like React.js (or Vue.js) to create a responsive, modern UI. The application will feature a clean chat interface where users can send and receive messages instantly without page reloads. The WebSocket connection will handle real-time communication with a server (e.g., Node.js + WebSocket library) and dynamically update the chat window as messages arrive. Message history will be maintained either temporarily in the browser state or persistently using a backend database. The design will include user avatars, timestamps, typing indicators, scrollable chat history, and mobile responsiveness, creating a smooth, interactive messaging experience across devices.
